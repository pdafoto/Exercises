# Exercises

This is a repository of small exercises I do on different courses.

## space.c (Code Academy):
Little Mac is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system.

Write a space.c program that helps him keep track of his target weight by: It should ask him what his earth weight is. Ask him to enter a number for the planet he wants to fight on. It should then compute his weight on the destination planet.

Here is the table of conversion:

| Number | Planet | Relative Gravity |
| :----: | :----- | :--------------: |
| 1	| Mercury | 0.38 |
| 2	| Venus | 0.91 |
| 3	| Mars | 0.38 |
| 4	| Jupiter | 2.34 |
| 5	| Saturn | 1.06 |
| 6	| Uranus | 0.92 |
| 7	| Neptune | 1.19 |

## Dates and Switches (Code Academy):
This is a classic coding project that utilizes `switch` statement logic to convert a given date into a familiar style displaying the month, day, and year all written out.

It may be complicated to wrap your head around at first, but after considering some cases, it may not be so tricky after all.

Want to give it a go?

Write a program that takes any user input in the format `mm/dd/yyyy` and prints it out in the style “January 1st, 2021.” (derived in English from whatever input is given).
