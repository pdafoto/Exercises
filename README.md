## space.c:
Little Mac is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system.

Write a space.c program that helps him keep track of his target weight by: It should ask him what his earth weight is. Ask him to enter a number for the planet he wants to fight on. It should then compute his weight on the destination planet.

Here is the table of conversion:

| Number | Planet | Relative Gravity |
| :----: | :----- | :--------------: |
| 1	| Mercury | 0.38 |
| 2	| Venus | 0.91 |
| 3	| Mars | 0.38 |
| 4	| Jupiter | 2.34 |
| 5	| Saturn | 1.06 |
| 6	| Uranus | 0.92 |
| 7	| Neptune | 1.19 |
